# Indigo ELN

## Build dependencies

- Java 1.8
- Maven 3.1
- GIT

## Profiles

IndigoEln comes with two Spring "profiles":

- "dev" for development: it focuses on ease of development and productivity
- "release" for production: it focuses on performance and scalability
Those profiles come in two different configurations:

The Maven profiles are used at build time. For example mvn -Prelease package will package a production application.
The Spring profiles work at run time. Some Spring beans will behave differently, depending on the profile.
Spring profiles are set by Maven, so we have a consistency between the two methods:you will have a "release" profile on Maven and Spring at the same time.

### In default mode, IndigoEln will use the "dev" profile

Create database in Mongo with special user (use role="readWrite"). Change connection settings in application-dev.properties

If you run the application without Maven, launch the "Application" class (you can probably run it easily from your IDE by right-clicking on it).

If you run the application with Maven, run mvn

### In production, IndigoEln has to run with the "release" profile
Use Maven to build the application with the "release" profile: mvn -Prelease

You can test it with Maven, by running mvn -Prelease

## Project Structure
IndigoEln client code can be found under src/main/webapp/scripts, it is structured similarly to projects generated by angular-fullstack
